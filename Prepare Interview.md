## Preparing for the interview
- Conduct additional reaearch on the company, so that you are thoroughly aware of its reputation, size, products, history, philosophy and culture. 
- Get the names and titles of the decision-makers you should meet.
- *If at all possible*, try to get inside information about the position and the people with whom you would be working. 
- Visit the company's website.
- Based on your research, tailor accomplishement stories to the position and organazation, and prepare your own questions about the company to ask during the interview. 

## Conducting the interview
- Always respond to questions with positive answers and by matching specific accomplishments and qualifications to the job. 
- Keep your answers to no-win questions brief.(As long as you give respect and show true empathy you tend to win people over.)
- Tailor and expand on the positioning statement you did in Milestone 3 to the needs of the job.
- It is the best way to respond to the request: tell me about yourself.
- Postpone salary discussions until an offer is made, if at all possible.
- If you are pressed to giive your salary, try to avoid naming a figure, you might lose your leverage for future negotiations.
